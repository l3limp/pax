### Motivation
Millions of people, of all ages, suffer from depression. We felt the need of developing an app that takes people's minds off things and helps them relax, with various videos, wellness, and fitness routines. helping them check off their tasks so that they feel a sense of accomplishment. Our main focus is "Activity of the day", where users are urged to do random activities to help unwind and relax, and then post about it.
